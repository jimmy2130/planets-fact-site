## My process

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

1. Use `transform: scale()` to make texts smaller than 12px.
2. Use Figma's Ruler to measure the design mockup.

### Useful resources

- [UseStickyState hook](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/persisting-react-state-in-localstorage/) - This helped me persist the states in local storage.

- [ShiftBy component](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-components/shift-by/) - This handy component helped me shift texts by few pixels in order to achieve optical alignment.

- [CSS-for-JS course by Josh W Comeau](https://css-for-js.dev) - Recommended CSS course.
